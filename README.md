### Hi there 👋

I'm Hao SU and I'm an undergraduate student of Shandong University(SDU).
I have just started to use GitHub as my remote repository and I'm always looking forward to trying out some new cool stuff.

- 🧐 I'm interested in linear algebra and statistics and their applications in machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning logic programming(namely Prolog) and machine learning. I'm also willing to learn about computational theory and other declarative languages.
