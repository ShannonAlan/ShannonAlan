### Hi there 👋

I have just started to use GitHub as my remote repository and I'm always looking forward to trying out some new cool stuff.

- 🧐 I'm interested in linear algebra and statistics and their applications in machine learning.
- 🌱 I have recently embarked an adventure into Analysis and Machine Learning. Wish to have a grasp of mathematics!
- 🧑🏻‍💻 I'm also planing to learn about computational theory and declarative languages(starting with Prolog).
- 🦄 Find out more about me at www.shannonalan.com
